# LetsBora App

#  iOS App Development

This iOS app is built using modern technologies and design patterns to ensure a seamless and responsive user experience.

## 🚀 Technology Stack

### 1. **UIKit** 🎨
UIKit is used for building the app's user interface, providing the necessary tools to create dynamic and responsive iOS interfaces.

### 2. **Swift** 🦅
Swift is the primary programming language for this app. 

### 3. **MVVM Architecture** 🏗️
The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** design pattern, which separates concerns between the user interface (View) and the underlying business logic (Model). This results in a clear structure for data binding and reusability.

- **Model**: Represents the data structure (events, users, costs, etc.).
- **View**: Displays the UI components to the user.
- **ViewModel**: Handles business logic and prepares data for presentation in the View. It communicates with the Model and provides a clean interface to bind data.
